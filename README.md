# Osussist
The best (and only) free tool that provides real-time aim assistance, tap assistance, and ban bypassing for the rhythm game osu. It is fully undetectable by the osu anti-cheat and open-source, so you can see how it works and even make it better if you want.

## Our features
- Aim Assist
- Semi-Legit Relax
- Built-in Spoofer support
- Local Config System

## Missing features
- Cloud configs
- Osu!Mania Bot
- Osu!Catch Bot

## Installation
Download the latest release on the [`Releases`](https://github.com/Osussist/OsussistExternal/releases) tab or compile it yourself by cloning the repo with:
```
git clone https://github.com/Osussist/OsussistExternal.git
```
After you have all the binaries and files needed you will need to get NET Runtime 4.8 (which you probably already have) and the [`Comfortaa`](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Comfortaa) font

## FAQ

- Why is the spoofer not working? <br>
A: You need to make your own / skid you own and put it in the same folder as the main binaries

- Will you update this any further? <br>
A: Maybe, if I feel like it

- Why is the code so messed up? <br>
